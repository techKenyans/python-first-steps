# Installing Python 3, Python Shell and PIP

Python has two versions mainly: Python 2 and Python 3.

Python 2 will be deprecated on January 1, 2020. We'll be using Python 3.

## Download & install

Download from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install.

> Add to Path

- Click on `Add to Path` in the installation windows, otherwise:

(On Windows)
- Navigate to **My Computer (System)/ Properties/ Advanced Settings/ Environment Variables** and add `c:\Python36\` _(for Python3)_

## Shell

Command to launch Python 3 is different in Mac.

In Mac, type in `python3`
In other operating systems, including windows, type `python`

You can type code in python shell and code as well!

You can use `print(5*4)`, and it shows **20**.

You can execute the code, and the shell would immediately give you output.

Using the the Python Shell is an awesome way to learn Python.

### PIP (package installer for Python)

Python3 comes with pip installed.
